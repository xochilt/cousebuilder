STUDENT_GROUPS_DESCRIPTION = """
Manage groups of students.  Group level settings can override course level
settings, and apply only to students in that group.  This page allows you
to manage group membership.  Configuration of per-group settings overrides
is done on pages for those settings.

Additionally, events recorded for students are marked with their current
group.  Certain analytics can be filtered to show only results relating
to individual groups.
"""

GROUP_MEMBERS_DESCRIPTION = """
A list of email addresses of students.  Student emails may be assigned to
groups before they are registered for the course.  Separate email addresses
with any combination of commas, spaces, tabs or newlines."""

EDIT_STUDENT_GROUPS_PERMISSION_DESCRIPTION = """
Allows creation, deletion, and modification of membership in groups of students.
Other permissions may be required to configure group-level settings to
override course-level settings -- e.g., to modify course/unit/lesson
availability.
"""

STUDENT_GROUP_ID_DESCRIPTION = """
Numeric ID of the group to which the student belongs, or null if the student
has not been assigned to any group.  This can be used directly for
grouping/aggregating data.
"""

STUDENT_GROUP_NAME_DESCRIPTION = """
Name of the group to which the student has been assigned, or null.  Note that
since student groups can be given the same name, you should not rely on this
field for aggregation, unless you are sure that no groups share a name.
"""

AVAILABILITY_DEFAULT_AVAILABILITY_DESCRIPTION = """
This is the current availability setting for this item at the course level.
"""

AVAILABILITY_OVERRIDDEN_AVAILABILITY_DESCRIPTION = """
Availability of course items can be overridden for students in this group,
or can default to using whatever the course-level setting is.
"""

GROUP_COURSE_AVAILABILITY = """
This sets the availability of the course for registered and unregistered
students in this group.
"""

ENABLE_GROUP_CACHING = """
If 'True', student groups are cached, with a one-hour refresh rate.
If you plan to change multiple student groups, or you otherwise need
your student group changes to take effect rapidly, this can be set to
'False'.  Otherwise, keep this setting at 'True' to maximize performance.
